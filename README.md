## What Is the Keto Diet?

The keto diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet that shifts the body's metabolism from glucose dependence to fat burning. This metabolic state, known as ketosis, allows the body to utilize fat for energy, leading to weight loss and various health improvements.

## Benefits of the Keto Diet

- **Weight Loss** â€“ The body burns fat for fuel, leading to weight reduction.
- **Mental Clarity** â€“ Ketones provide a stable energy source for the brain.
- **Blood Sugar Control** â€“ Reducing carbohydrates can help stabilize blood sugar levels.
- **Increased Energy Levels** â€“ Fewer blood sugar crashes result in sustained energy.
- **Reduced Inflammation** â€“ The diet's anti-inflammatory properties promote overall wellness.
